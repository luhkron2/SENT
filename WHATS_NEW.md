## 🤖 Smart AI Predictions

**Your AI co-pilot for issue reporting**

As you type your description, the app analyzes it and suggests:

- ✅ **Priority Level** - Is it CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW?
- ✅ **Category** - Mechanical? Electrical? Brakes?
- ✅ **Safety Status** - Safe to drive? Unsure? Definitely not?
- ✅ **Next Steps** - What should you do right now?

### Example:
You type: *"Brakes making grinding noise and not stopping well"*

AI suggests:
- Priority: **HIGH** ⚠️
- Category: **Brakes** 🔧
- Safe to Drive: **No** 🚫
- Action: *Have vehicle towed to workshop*

No more guessing!

## 🔔 Push Notifications

**Stay in the loop, hands-free**

Enable notifications once, and you'll get instant alerts when:

- ✅ Operations acknowledges your issue
- ✅ A mechanic is assigned
- ✅ Your repair is scheduled
- ✅ Your vehicle is ready for pickup

**Works even when the app is closed!**

Tap the notification to jump straight to your issue details.

## 📸 Automatic Image Compression

**Upload faster, use less data**

Photos are automatically compressed before upload:
- **Before**: 3-5 MB per photo
- **After**: 300-800 KB per photo
- **You save**: 80% data usage

Works seamlessly in the background. You won't even notice it's happening!

Perfect for slow connections or limited data plans.
